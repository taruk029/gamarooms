              The layoff is the biggest setback in working professional's life and a job seeker runs from pillar to post to get help like Job recommendations or establishing a connection with HR or also sometimes loses confidence in facing interviews. All you need during this time is a friend who stands by you and helps you in finding a suitable job till you are not placed. </p>

              Based on your inputs, we understand you are not a laid-off job seeker which means we can not offer you free support. 

In case you would like to purchase a subscription of our services ( Hidden Job Search Support, Speed networking, Interview Coaching ), please reply back to this mail with your query. 

The prime objective of this initiative is not to make money but to help laid-off job seekers however these charges will help us meet our tech cost. 

In case you have a friend who is laid off feel free to refer them to  <a href="www.outplacementheros.org">www.outplacementHeros.org</a></p>
